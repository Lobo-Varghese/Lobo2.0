 * ABSTRACTION - Abstract(god,angel,devil)
 * ************
 * Hiding the implementation details
 * 
 * How to achieve abstraction
 * **************************
 * 1)Abstract Class(0 to 100% Abstraction/ Partial Abstarction)
 * 2)Interface(100% Abstraction/ Full Abstraction)
 * 
 * Properties:
 * ***********
 * 1)If Class having unimplemented method, then method should be abstract
 * 2)If Class is having one abstract method the class should be declared abstract
 * 3)It may or may not have implemented method(concrete methods)
 * 4)A class can be declared abstract even if it doesn't have abstract method
 * 5)Can we create a object for Abstract class? NOOOOOOO. Even if one method not implemented we cant create object
 * 
 * INTERFACE
 * **********
 * Like a class , but not a class
 * 
 * Why like a class, but not a class?
 * **********************************
 * Interface cab have methods and variables like a class
 *	1) But variables are public,static and final by default
 * 	2) Methods are abstract by default
 * 
 * Can we create Object for Interface?
 * ************************************
 * NOOO, method doesn't have body or its abstract.
 * Atleast for abstract class few method are concrete.
 * 
 * Why Interface Needed?
 * ********************* * 
 * To achieve absolute abstraction and Multiple Inheritance
 *
 *How Class use Interface?
 *************************
 *Using Implements Keyword
 *
 *HOw interface use another interface?
 *************************************
 *Using Extends keyword
 *
 *Marker Interface?
 *****************
 *Interface without any method or variable
 *Ex: Serializable,Cloneable
 *
 *
 *ENCAPSULATION
 ***************
 *Binding of data and method in a class is encapsulation
